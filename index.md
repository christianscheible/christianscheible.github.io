[I am a researcher](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/~scheibcn/) at the [Institute for Natural Language
Processing](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/) (IMS) at the [University
of Stuttgart](http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/).

I write software that enables computers to automatically extract
information from natural language using machine learning. I work
primarily in Java or Python.

In the past, I have worked primarily on text analysis. This includes
semantic analysis, discourse processing, and sentiment analysis.

I like building tools from scratch (see below), and I also work with
natural language processing and machine learning tools.


## Software 

### [QSample](http://github.com/christianscheible/qsample) 

An open source Java tool for detecting quoted speech in text. It
provides a greedy algorithm for fast processing and sampling inference
for higher accuracy.

### [Bayesian Naive Bayes](http://github.com/christianscheible/BNB) 

A Python implementation of two-class Naive Bayes with additional
priors. Inference is done using Gibbs sampling. I used this model for
unsupervised sentiment analysis.

### [Chess ratings](http://github.com/christianscheible/chessratings) 

A Python tool to automatically predict the strength of chess players.
Uses an SVM to perform classification, ranking, and regression.


## Data

### [Sentiment relevance](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/sr)

Sentiment relevance captures whether a piece of text contains an opinion
or not. This dataset of movie reviews contains close to 4000 sentences
annotated for sentiment relevance.

### [Chess commentary](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/chess) 

This corpus consists of annotated chess games that were posted on
chess.com. I used this dataset to automatically predict the strength of
chess players.

### [Deep semantic analogies](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/lexika/analogies_ims/analogies.html)

A collection of word analogy problems (e.g., *man is to woman as king is
to ?*) in multiple languages.
