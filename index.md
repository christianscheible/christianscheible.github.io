I am a data scientist at [StepStone](https://www.stepstone.com/) living 
in Cologne, Germany.  Previously, I
was a researcher at the [Institute for Natural Language
Processing](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/) (IMS) at the University of
Stuttgart.

I write software that enables computers to automatically extract
information from natural language and other data sources using machine learning. 
I work primarily in Java or Python.

In the past, I have worked primarily on text analysis. This includes
semantic analysis, discourse processing, and sentiment analysis. 

I am used to building tools from scratch, but I also work with natural
language processing and machine learning libraries.


## Software 

### [QSample](http://github.com/christianscheible/qsample) 

An open source Java tool for detecting quoted speech in text. It
provides a greedy algorithm for fast processing and sampling inference
for higher accuracy.

### [Bayesian Naive Bayes](http://github.com/christianscheible/BNB) 

A Python implementation of two-class Naive Bayes with additional
priors. Inference is done using Gibbs sampling. I used this model for
unsupervised sentiment analysis.

### [Chess ratings](http://github.com/christianscheible/chessratings) 

A Python tool to automatically predict the strength of chess players.
Uses an SVM to perform classification, ranking, and regression.


## Data

### [Sentiment relevance](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/sr)

Sentiment relevance captures whether a piece of text contains an opinion
or not. This dataset of movie reviews contains close to 4000 sentences
annotated for sentiment relevance.

### [Chess commentary](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/chess) 

This corpus consists of annotated chess games that were posted on
chess.com. I used this dataset to automatically predict the strength of
chess players.

### [Deep semantic analogies](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/lexika/analogies_ims/analogies.html)

A collection of word analogy problems (e.g., *man is to woman as king is
to ?*) in multiple languages.
