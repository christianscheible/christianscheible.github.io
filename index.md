[I am a researcher](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/~scheibcn/) at the [Institute for Natural Language
Processing](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/) (IMS) at the [University
of Stuttgart](http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/).

I develop software that enables computers to automatically extract
information from natural language using machine learning.

My work focuses on text mining. This includes semantic analysis,
discourse processing, and sentiment analysis.

I like building tools from scratch, and I also work with natural
language processing and machine learning tools.


## Software 

### [QSample](http://github.com/christianscheible/qsample) 

An open source Java tool for detecting quoted speech in text. It
provides a greedy algorithm for fast processing and sampling inference
for higher accuracy.

### [Bayesian Naive Bayes](http://github.com/christianscheible/qsample) 

An open source Python implementation of two-class Naive Bayes with
additional priors. Inference is done using Gibbs sampling. I used this
model for unsupervised sentiment analysis.



## Data

### [Sentiment Relevance](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/sr)

Sentiment relevance captures whether a piece of text contains an opinion
or not. This dataset of movie reviews contains close to 4000 sentences
annotated for sentiment relevance.

### [Chess commentary](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/chess) 

This corpus consists of annotated chess games that were posted on
chess.com. I used this dataset to automatically predict the strength of
chess players.
